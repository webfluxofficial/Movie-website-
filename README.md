## 🛠️ High-level Setup (what you'll learn)
1. **Domain & Hosting** — Choose a provider, point DNS to your server or host, enable HTTPS.  
2. **Database** — Set up a relational DB (MySQL/Postgres) or a lightweight DB for small projects.  
3. **Storage** — Store media safely (object storage, S3-compatible, or local server storage for personal use).  
4. **Backend** — API server for uploads, streaming endpoints, and admin routes.  
5. **Admin Panel** — Login, media management, user moderation, and simple analytics.  
6. **Security** — Keep secrets in `.env`, enable HTTPS, validate uploads, and rate-limit endpoints.
